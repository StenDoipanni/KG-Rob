===== GRAPH ENRICHMENT SUMMARY =====

Original text: "Inside a barred circus cage, a man—clearly the Tramp character played by Charlie Chaplin (agent)—is caught in a moment of intense comedic tension as he holds a large, flat object like a shield (instrument) between himself and a full-grown lion (theme) lying on the floor just feet away. The man's wide-eyed expression and stiff posture convey alarm and desperation as he edges backward, clearly aware of the imminent danger. Despite the threat, the lion remains completely still, its eyes closed, resting its massive head on its paws in a pose of total indifference. The man's defensive stance and panicked energy are in stark contrast to the lion's calm, creating a powerful visual irony central to the comedy."

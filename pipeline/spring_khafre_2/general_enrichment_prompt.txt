Task:
Your goal is to extend a knowledge graph KG with more knowledge that can be assumed from a text T, but it is not explicit.
Using the elements of KG, as well as PropBank, WordNet and other graph elements as anchoring points, add any further elements you need to extract implicit knowledge about:
1. Implied Future Events
2. Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events
3. Danger Avoidance Actions
4. Risk Reduction Reactions

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST start with the following prefix declarations:
@prefix kh: <file://./log.owl#> .
@prefix pblr: <https://w3id.org/framester/data/propbank-3.4.0/LocalRole/> .
@prefix fschema: <https://w3id.org/framester/schema/> .

If you add further prefixes, make sure to declare them.

Start with Implied Future Events. An implied future event happens when two events mentioned in a text have a causal dependence sequence; here are natural language inference examples:
1) The car driver didn't notice the traffic light turns red. -> The car driver won't stop at the traffic light.
Here is the rough triplification, you will be more precise and use KG nodes, PropBank, WordNet, and WikiData entities as anchor point:
1) en:carDriver en:notStoppingAt en:TrafficLight .
en:CarDriverStoppingAtTrafficLight a dul:Situation ; en:hasValue "False"^^xsd:boolean .
en:CarDriverStoppingAtTrafficLight en:hasParticipant en:CarDriver .
en:CarDriverStoppingAtTrafficLight en:hasParticipant en:TrafficLight .

Add Implied Future Event triples to the KG considering the original text T.

Proceed with Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events. In some cases, an implied future event can be dangerous. Here are natural language inference examples:
1) The car does not stop at traffic lights. There are pedestrian in the crosswalk. --> The people could be hit by the car.
2) After checking the arrival of cars, the pedestrian is crossing on the crosswalk.
Here is the rough triplification, you will be more precise and use KG nodes, PropBank, WordNet, and WikiData entities as anchor point:
1) en:CarNotStopping en:introducesDanger "true"^^xsd:boolean .
2) en:PedestrianCrossingOnCrosswalk en:isDangerous "false"^^xsd:boolean .

Add Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events triples to the KG considering the original text T and the Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events.

Add now Danger Avoidance Actions, namely the actions that should have happened to avoid the danger. 
Here are natural language inference examples:
1) The car does not stop at traffic lights. There are pedestrians in the crosswalk. --> The car should have stopped at the traffic light.
Here is the rough triplification, you will be more precise and use KG nodes, PropBank, WordNet, and WikiData entities as anchor point:
1) en:CarStopping en:isDangerAvoidanceAction "true"^^xsd:boolean .

Add Danger Avoidance Actions triples to the KG considering the original text T and the Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events.

Finally, add Risk Reduction Reaction, namely the reactions that could happen, once the danger exists, to reduce the impact of the danger. Here are natural language inference examples:
1) The car does not stop at traffic lights. There are pedestrians in the crosswalk. --> The pedestrians could quickly jump back to avoid the car.
Here is the rough triplification, you will be more precise and use KG nodes, PropBank, WordNet, and WikiData entities as anchor point:
1) en:PedestrianJumpingBack a dul:Situation ; en:hasRiskReductionValue 0.5 .
en:PedestrianJumpingBack en:hasParticipant en:pedestrian .

Add Risk Reduction Reactions triples to the KG considering the original text T and the Potentially Dangerous Implied Future Events.

IMPORTANT: Print the newly generater triples only. Do not write anything else.
If you introduce Datatype and Object properties add a triple declaring them as such.
